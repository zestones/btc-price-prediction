# BTC PRICE PREDICTION

This is splited into 2 parts, the first one is the prediction of the price of the bitcoin using two different methods : 
- The first one is trying to classify the price of the bitcoin into 2 categories : -1 or 1 (decrease or increase)
- The second one is trying to predict the price of the bitcoin using Deep Learning methods

In the second part of the project, we are trying to analyse the network of the bitcoin using the graph theory. We are trying to find communities in the network to analyse the evolution of the network over time.

Check the [report](report/Big_Data_Report.pdf) for the full analysis and experimentation.

## Getting Started

In order to run the project, you need to install the requirements.txt file. You can do it by running the following command : 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We worked on notebooks, so you can run the different notebooks to see the results of our work.
The ``network_analysis.ipynb`` notebook is the one where we analyse the network of the bitcoin. The ``price_prediction.ipynb`` notebook is the one where we try to predict the price of the bitcoin.
The ``classification.ipynb`` notebook is the one where we try to predict the price of the bitcoin using classification methods.
